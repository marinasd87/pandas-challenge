# pandas-challenge
For pandas challenge I'm analyzing date from the most recen fantasy game from an independent gaming company. I'm generating a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.
The most important trends that we can observe after analyzing the data are:
1. The majority of the players are men.
2. Women spend 10% more than men but are only 15% of the population.
3. Almost 45% of the population is between 20 and 24 yo.
4. The population between 35 and 39 yo makes the most expensive purchases and has the biggest average total purchase per person.
5. The two most popular items are also the most profitable (Final Critic and Oathbreaker).
